    "### Defining productivity\n",
    "So how can we **quantify productivity**? There would be many ways to do this, but my approach is simple: assume that productivity is directly proportional to the minutes of schoolwork logged (in some timeframe). This way, if I goofed off, I wouldn't have recorded any work, so `Minutes` would be 0. An extra benefit of totalling the *minutes worked* rather than the *amount of tasks done in a day* is that we don't interpret doing many small tasks as 'being more productive' than doing one large task (also, we lack sufficient data to count entries as units of productivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be argued this approach is counterintuitive given **productivity** is largely thought of alongside **efficiency**, and this approach may actually penalize efficiency by rewarding longer tasks (even if the effort is low). However, since our sample is quite small, my intuition says we can't reliably derive a measure like *minutes worked per **complete** task*, so we'll stick to the prior approach. As an aside, this is an example of an assumption and design decision made in the data science process that may fundamentally alter the results of an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's add a new row to our data frame called `Minutes` that is the total minutes worked for one entry. We can pass the string `Duration` to a function to convert the `HH:MM:SS` format to a numeric type:"

To interpret this, we can say that if we repeated the experiment for minutes worked on rainy/non-rainy days, and there really was no impact of rain on minutes worked, the probability of seeing **more** minutes worked for rainy days than non-rainy days to the extent we saw or to a greater extent just by chance is 30%.\n",

    "As is typical with analysis of small samples, more data are needed to conclusively suggest there is any difference in (my) productivity owing to the weather. Looking back at the linear model, perhaps an interesting route to explore is `humidity` due to its notable *t*-statistic and seemingly borderline association ( $p\\approx0.1$). Of course, this may very well be solely due to chance (the more low-quality features we include, the more likely we find a non-existent correlation due to chance).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, I'm happy I had the opportunity to poke around in some of my old data and refresh my pandas/R/Altair skils, and conduct some surface-level exploratory analysis even if the results were inconclusive. As is sometimes the case with throwaway personal projects, the famous saying can be invoked — it's about the journey, not the destination."
