    "## Circular primes\n",
    "\n",
    "The above riddle is an example of a _constraint satisfaction problem_ (CSP), a special type of problem in which variables that have domains must be allocated values to satisfy some set of constraints. In the case of this particular riddle, we could model the 14 positions on the circle as variables $x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{13}$ (where we consider $x_{13}$ and $x_0$ to be neighbors), and the domain for each variable would be the integers 1–14.\n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle essentially boils down to two constraints on the variables: (1) each number from 1–14 must be used exactly once, and (2) the sum and difference of every pair of adjacent numbers must be prime. With these two constraints in mind, we can work toward building a general solver for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prolog introduction and logical primality tests\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll need a way to identify primes. Prolog is a logic programming language, so it operates with _predicates_ instead of _functions_ — predicates are statements about some input(s) that either hold or don't hold. [One way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23282097/prolog-program-to-check-if-a-number-is-prime) of testing primality in Prolog can be achieved via the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "%% is_prime(+N)\n",
    "%\n",
    "% Holds if N is a prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_prime(2) :- !.\n",
    "is_prime(3) :- !.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_prime(N) :-\n",
    "  N > 3,\n",
    "  N mod 2 =\\= 0,\n",
    "  is_prime(N, 3).\n",
    "is_prime(N, X) :-\n",
    "  ( X*X > N ->\n",
    "    true\n",
    "  ; N mod X =\\= 0,\n",
    "    M is X + 2,\n",
    "    is_prime(N, M)\n",
    "  ).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And while the goal of this post is to demonstrate Prolog — not teach it — I recognize some background is still necessary, so the following will hopefully serve as a whirlwind tour of Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, there are two main ways of interfacing with Prolog: facts/rules, and queries. _Facts_ and _rules_ determine what can be queried, and they define expressions either declaratively or implicitly, respectively. For example, `married(bob, john).` is a fact declaring Bob to be married to John. An example of a rule could be `is_single(Person) :- not(married(Person, _) ; married(_, Person)).` which says that a person is single if they are not married to someone else (we need to account for both positions/relations in the `married` fact). Similar to a wildcard, the underscore indicates any person (we assume people cannot marry themselves).\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicates are defined with the syntax `head :- body.` which reads as \"the predicate `head` holds if `body` holds.\" And the body of a predicate consists of clauses linked by conjunctions (\"and\"s with a comma `,`), disjunctions (\"or\"s with a semicolon `;`), and are ended with a period `.`. Variables begin with uppercase letters, and constants (called _atoms_) begin with a lowercase. When we write `is_prime(2) :- !.` in the above code, we assert `is_prime` holds for the number two (or, that the number 2 is prime). The `!` (called a _cut_) makes this subtly different, but we'll get to that shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Querying_ in Prolog lets you interact with the \"database\" you've built from facts and rules/predicates. For example, if we query\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- is_single(john).\n",
    "false.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we see that John is not single — i.e., he is married to someone. Now, let's say we want to find out who is married to whom. Since we know John isn't single, let's write a query for his spouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- married(john, Person) ; married(Person, john).\n",
    "Person = bob.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "`Person` in the query is a variable (indicated by its uppercase starting character). Prolog shows us what `Person` was _bound_ to in order to satisfy the query — in other words, if you \"plug in\" the result from Prolog, your query will evalute to true. You can think of it like Prolog saying: \"here's what needs to be true for the query to hold.\" Note that here we have to write the `married/2` relation twice to account for `john` being in either position in `married/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are multiple ways to satisfy a query, Prolog will enumerate all possibilities. We can demonstrate this by adding another partner for John with the fact `married(john, sam).`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- married(john, P) ; married(P, john).\n",
    "P = sam ;\n",
    "P = bob.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to mention that Prolog's inference engine features _backtracking_, which means it will generate multiple pathways for an execution to follow, pursue one, and then follow up on any paths that could satisfy the query later. In the above query, pressing `;` will search for further satisfying bindings, and `.` will terminate the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this brief primer gives you some intuition for the primality test code above. Some additional useful syntax to know is that `( X -> Y ; Z )` is an if-then-else block (`if X then Y else Z`), and predicates can share names as long as they have different *arity* (number of predicate arguments), which is typically written after the predicate name with a forward slash, e.g. `is_prime/1` and `is_prime/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translating satisfiable conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can test for prime numbers, we need a predicate to determine whether the sum and difference of two numbers are prime:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "%% prime_sumdiff(+N, +M)\n",
    "%\n",
    "% Holds if the sum and difference of N and M are both primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "prime_sumdiff(N, M) :-\n",
    "  Sum is N + M,\n",
    "  Diff is abs(N - M),\n",
    "  is_prime(Sum),\n",
    "  is_prime(Diff).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is pretty simple: it takes two numbers `N` and `M`, computes their sum and difference (in Prolog, `is` evaluates an expression), and only holds if both are prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to iteratively place our numbers in a circle, we can represent positions as a list, placing numbers left-to-right and ensuring that the last and first numbers also meet the prime sum-difference condition. While there are many ways to approach this, here's a recursive definition of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base case**: all numbers have been placed correctly except for the last one, which must \"fit\" with $x_{n-2}$ and $x_0$ (the penultimate and first numbers)\n",
    "* **Recursive case**: we must place some number $x_i$ next to the previous number $x_{i-1}$ while satisfying the prime sum-difference condition, and then place any remaining numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can translate this into a predicate `place_adjacents/3`, starting with the base case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "%% place_adjacents(+Nums, -Placements, +Acc)\n",
    "%\n",
    "% Places each number in a list Nums into a circular list Placements in which\n",
    "% each pair satisfies the prime sum-difference condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "% base case\n",
    "place_adjacents([N], Placements, [First|Acc]) :-\n",
    "  last(Acc, Last), % need to place the last number\n",
    "  prime_sumdiff(Last, N),\n",
    "  prime_sumdiff(N, First),\n",
    "  append([First|Acc], [N], Placements).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, this predicate takes the last number of our list of numbers to place, and ensures it meets the prime sum-difference condition with the first and last elements of the list-so-far before appending the number to the list-so-far, yielding the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Prolog's pattern matching to indicate that this predicate is only applicable when the first argument is a singleton list (with the last number `N` to place), meaning the predicate will only ever be used during the base case. `Placements` is the final placement list, and `[First|Acc]` is the list of digits so far with `First` being the first element (head) of the list and `Acc` the rest (tail) (in Prolog, the pipe character `|` is the construct operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can similarly model the recursive case as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "% recursive case\n",
    "place_adjacents(Nums, Placements, Acc) :-\n",
    "  select(N, Nums, Nums1), % select the number to place\n",
    "  last(Acc, Last),\n",
    "  prime_sumdiff(Last, N),\n",
    "  append(Acc, [N], Acc1),\n",
    "  place_adjacents(Nums1, Placements, Acc1).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which uses the built-in `select/3` predicate to retrieve $x_i$ (`N`) from the available numbers `Nums`, leaving us with one less number in `Nums1`. Then, we compare $x_{i}$ with $x_{i-1}$ and add it to our list if it's compatible. To place the remaining digits, we recurse. Note that `select/3` is used because it is \"nondeterministic\" and selects _any_ number from our list of numbers to place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bringing it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "With the bulk of the solver done, we need to \"glue\" our predicates together to create a simple interface. One implementation quirk we need to be careful of is that $x_{i-1}$ always exists in the recursive case (i.e. the accumulated list is never empty), so we need to ensure our main predicate begins with a number in the list (keeping in mind that it doesn't matter which number we start with, since a circular list has no \"start\" or \"end\").\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "%% circular_primes(+Low, +High, -Placements)\n",
    "%\n",
    "% Pairs numbers in a range [Low, High] such that the sums and differences of\n",
    "% adjacent pairs of numbers in a circular list Placements are primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "circular_primes(Low, High, Placements) :-\n",
    "  Low < High,\n",
    "  bagof(N, between(Low, High, N), Nums),\n",
    "  select(First, Nums, NewNums), % select the first candidate number\n",
    "  place_adjacents(NewNums, Placements, [First]).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This predicate accepts a valid lower and upper bound such that $\\forall i:x_i\\in\\left[\\verb|Low|,\\verb|High|\\right]$. Here, `bagof` is used to take all unique `N` such that `N` is between `Low` and `High`, storing the list in `Nums` (this specific usage of `bagof` is similar to Python's `range()` function). We also initialize the placement list with `First`, and state that in order for `circular_primes/3` to hold, we must be able to place the remaining numbers `NewNums` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! All that's left is to enter query mode and ask Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- circular_primes(1, 14, Ps).\n",
    "Ps = [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 6, 11, 8, 3, 14, 9, 2, 5, 12] .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With the numbers 1–14, the predicate succeeds with the above placement specification. If we ask Prolog to keep generating solutions, we yield all of the different \"rotations\" or \"shifts\" (and reflections) of the circular list (for this example, there is only one unique solution):\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- circular_primes(1, 14, Ps).\n",
    "Ps = [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 6, 11, 8, 3, 14, 9, 2, 5, 12] ;\n",
    "Ps = [1, 12, 5, 2, 9, 14, 3, 8, 11, 6, 13, 10, 7, 4] ;\n",
    "Ps = [2, 5, 12, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 6, 11, 8, 3, 14, 9] ;\n",
    "Ps = [2, 9, 14, 3, 8, 11, 6, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1, 12, 5] ;\n",
    "Ps = [3, 8, 11, 6, 13, 10, 7, 4, 1, 12, 5, 2, 9, 14] .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the best part is, since we've written a general solver for this type of question, we can ask Prolog for solutions for any range of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- circular_primes(6, 24, Ps). % this has no solution\n",
    "false.\n",
    "\n",
    "?- circular_primes(6, 23, Ps).\n",
    "Ps = [6, 11, 8, 15, 22, 19, 12, 7, 10, 21, 16, 13, 18, 23, 20, 9, 14, 17] .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A technical note on implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, a brief note on alternative approaches — feel free to [skip this part](#Futoshiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question for a Prolog programmer at this point may be \"Why not use CLP(FD)?\" After all, this problem can (very easily) be described in the following two predicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\forall i \\forall j : x_i,x_j\\in\\left[1,14\\right]\\wedge x_i\\ne x_j$\n",
    "2. $\\forall i : \\text{Prime}\\left(x_i+x_{(i+1)\\bmod 15}\\right)\\wedge\\text{Prime}\\left(\\left|x_i-x_{(i+1)\\bmod 15}\\right|\\right)$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[Futoshiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki) (不等式) is a logic puzzle game about inequalities. Each puzzle grid is a $n\\times n$ board with optional starting numbers, and given inequality symbols ($<$ and $>$). A solved puzzle is a [Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square) where the digits $1$ to $n$ appear exactly once in each column and row, similar to Sudoku. The twist is that digits within cells must also satisfy any surrounding inequalities. Refer to the image below for an example:\n",

The emboldened numbers are supplied to begin.</figcaption></figure>\n",

    "\n",
    "From an objective point of view, though, Futoshiki is just another constraint satisfaction problem: we want to slot the numbers $1$–$n$ in unique board positions such that the Latin square property holds and all inequalities are satisfied. Since we can define the game in terms of properties that _should be true in a solved state_, we can try implementing a solver in Prolog!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing the game board\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $n\\times n$ grid, we'll use the standard approach of nested arrays — but we still need a way to represent inequalities on the board with respect to different squares. One way of doing this is to specify an array of `(row, col)` pairs and describe the relationship between them. In the above example board, we can represent the inequality on the fourth row as `(4,4)<(4,5)` if we use one-based indexing and define `(1,1)` to be the top-left cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "None of the above three puzzles are particularly challenging or computationally difficult. They _could_ be solved in other languages, but the point is that Prolog was designed exactly for the kind of problems exhibited in this post, and it really shows. Modeling problems in Prolog _feels_ satisfying, regardless of whether implementations are rough and inefficient (like in the circular primes problem), or well-defined systems of constraints (like in Futoshiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a practical incentive for using Prolog: more often than not, modeling CSPs or other problems in Prolog just makes sense — why should I go to the trouble of building my own backtracking or dynamic programming algorithm for every scenario I face, when I could benefit from Prolog's inference engine and great libraries like CLP(FD)/CLP(Z)?\n",
